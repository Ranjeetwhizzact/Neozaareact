          <p className="mb-6 text-black">
           When we transfer personal information outside India or the region in which it was originally collected, we ensure
           that such transfers comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws, including the Digital Personal Data 
           Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act) and other relevant international standards such as the General Data Protection 
           Regulation (GDPR) where applicable.
          </p>

             mechanisms under the DPDP Act and other recognized privacy frameworks.

          <p className="mb-6 text-black">

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-black">11. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
          <p className="mb-6  text-black">
            NeoZaar processes personal data only when there is a lawful and legitimate basis to do so. The legal grounds 
            on which we rely include, but are not limited to, the following:
          </p>
           <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2  text-black">
          <li>
              <strong>Consent:</strong> When you voluntarily provide your information or explicitly agree to data collection and processing activities for specific purposes such as marketing communications, platform access, or participation in partner programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> When processing is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (for example, account creation, marketplace participation, or product listing).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> When processing is required to pursue NeoZaar’s legitimate business interests, including improving services, enhancing user experience, ensuring platform security, and enabling business partnerships — provided such interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compliance with Legal Obligations:</strong> When processing is required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, court orders, or government directives.
              </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Protection of Vital Interests:</strong> In rare cases, when processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of an individual or to prevent potential harm.
              </li>
              </ul>
            <p className="mb-6  text-black">

          </p>
          <p className="mb-6  text-black">
            NeoZaar does not rely solely on consent where another lawful basis (such as contract or legitimate interest) is appropriate, and will ensure that any processing based on consent is freely given, specific, informed, and revocable at any time.
